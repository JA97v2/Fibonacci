# Fibonacci
---
There are three versions of Fibonacci to show the difference between recursive and dynamic programming.
## Usage
Just change the p value and execute, you can delete the for at the end of the code if you only want to get one specific value.
## Recursion
Be careful with the recursive version because higher numbers will take a lot of time to be obtained.
## Dynamic programming
This have two versions:
### Without memory cleaning
This means that all the values are stored in the list, even if you don't need them.
### With memory cleaning
This means that only the two last values are stored, because the other ones aren't necessary to calculate the last value.
